# ShaStore
The advance of cloud computing technology makes everything more accessible by our hands, one of them is Cloud Storage. The convenience and accessibility of cloud storage blind the customers to put their files, even the sensitive files, without thinking of the providerâ€™s terms and conditions. Although wellinformed users understand the terms and conditions, the sensitive information in the files is on the risk of being stolen or used for malicious purposes. This study introduces SHASTORE which securely encrypt the files before they get uploaded to the cloud storage. SHASTORE uses state-of-the-art encryption technology and allows users to avoid trusting the encryption keys to any third parties. With no connection to the internet, SHASTORE keeps all sensitive data on the physical device while the SHASTORE server has zero knowledge of those data. The main research contribution of this paper is the True Zero-Knowledge offline encryption system that enables encrypted file sharing across usertrusted devices to retain the absolute convenience of personal cloud storage. This paper elucidates the theoretical model of the system and proves that it can withstand data leakage, device hacking and internal attack. We also implement and evaluate the system on off-the-shelf devices. The result shows SHASTORE will only pose up to 9.7% overall performance overhead.
